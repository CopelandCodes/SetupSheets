# Overview
This project is a Setup Sheets application designed to help CNC machinists and operators manage part setups efficiently. The app allows users to record and organize important details about parts, including tooling information, coordinate setups, and notes. As a software engineer, I wanted to enhance my skills by building a fully interactive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using modern development tools. My goal was to combine clean architecture, intuitive user interfaces, and robust database management to build a tool that could be used in real-world manufacturing settings.

The app features:

* A main screen listing all parts with search functionality.
* An editor screen for adding or editing part details.
* The ability to record tooling, coordinates, and notes.
* Confirmation prompts before deleting any data.

# Development Environment

IDE: Android Studio
Language: Kotlin
Framework: Jetpack Compose for the UI
Database: Local persistence using Room
Version Control: Git and GitHub
Device: Android Emulator

# Future Work

* Implement user authentication for data protection.
* Tool library to store common tools for easier documentation
* Give user option to create a Mill setup or Lathe setup option with related fields
* Add part viewing screen in place of automatically editing part
* Add cloud-based backup and synchronization options.
* Integrate advanced search features like filters and tags.
* Improve UI responsiveness and error handling.
